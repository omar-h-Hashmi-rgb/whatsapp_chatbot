**A WhatsApp-style interface for autonomous calendar coordination using LLMs and Google Calendar.**

## 📖 Overview

Scheduling conflicts are a major bottleneck in educational and professional environments. The **AI-Driven Scheduling Assistant** eliminates manual coordination by using a Large Language Model (Llama 3 via Groq) to understand natural language requests and an intelligent backend to manage Google Calendar events.

Unlike simple booking tools, this assistant features an **autonomous conflict resolution engine**. If a requested slot is taken, the system doesn't just reject the request—it intelligently negotiates and "swaps" appointments to maximize the instructor's calendar utilization, ensuring high efficiency without human intervention.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a responsive WhatsApp-clone UI, and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety.
*   **Backend Logic**: Next.js API Routes (Serverless functions).
*   **AI/LLM**: [Groq SDK](https://groq.com/) running Llama 3 for millisecond-latency intent recognition and natural language generation.
*   **Database**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (PostgreSQL) for user metadata and persistent chat history.
*   **Integration**: [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar) via Service Account for real-time bi-directional synchronization.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Smart Conflict Resolution (Slot-Swap Algorithm)
The core innovation of this system. When a user requests a slot that is already occupied:
1.  The system identifies the conflict.
2.  It creates a "Smart Swap" proposal.
3.  It autonomously moves the conflicting appointment to the requester's old slot (or another optimal time) and books the requester in their desired slot.
4.  This ensures the schedule remains fully booked and optimized.

### 💬 Natural Language Interface
Users interact naturally without complex forms:
*   *"Move me to Tuesday afternoon."*
*   *"I'm running late, can we push it back an hour?"*
*   *"Cancel my lesson next week."*

### 📅 Multi-Calendar Architecture
Simulates a robust real-world environment by managing a master Instructor calendar alongside individual student sub-calendars, calculating availability across the entire ecosystem.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The system follows a modern event-driven flow:

1.  **User** sends a message via the Next.js Chat Interface.
2.  **API Route** receives the payload and fetches user context from **Supabase**.
3.  **Groq AI** parses the natural language to extract Intent (`reschedule`, `query`) and Entities (`target_date`, `time`).
4.  **Calendar Engine** calculates availability using the **Google Calendar API**.
5.  **Optimization Logic** executes the Smart Swap if a conflict is detected.
6.  **Response** is generated by AI and sent back to the UI.

(See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for a detailed diagram).

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js 18+
*   Supabase Account (PostgreSQL)
*   Google Cloud Service Account (with Calendar API enabled)
*   Groq API Key

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Groq AI
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

# Google Calendar
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=your_compressed_json_credentials
# OR
GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=service_account_email
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=service_account_private_key
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scheduling-assistant.git
    cd scheduling-assistant/chatbot
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## ⚖️ Engineering Trade-offs & Future Roadmap

*   **Trade-off (Optimization vs. Confirmation)**: The current "Smart Swap" executes immediately to demonstrate the algorithmic capability. In a production consumer app, a "Request Confirmation" step would be introduced before moving a third party's appointment.
*   **Trade-off (UI Simulation)**: A web-based WhatsApp clone was chosen over the WhatsApp Business API to allow for rapid prototyping and to bypass Meta's business verification process for this release.
*   **Future Roadmap**:
    *   Implement 3-way swap logic for complex chain conflicts.
    *   Integrate Twilio/WhatsApp Business API for SMS/WhatsApp native support.
    *   Add User Authentication (Auth0 or Supabase Auth).
